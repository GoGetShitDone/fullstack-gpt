       "'Victory Mansions is a building with glass doors and a hallway that smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. There is a large colored poster of a man with a black mustache and ruggedly handsome features. The building has stairs because the lift is seldom working, and the flat is seven flights up. On each landing, there is a poster with an enormous face that seems to follow you when you move. Inside the flat, there is a telescreen, which is an oblong metal plaque that cannot be completely shut off. The flat has a window, and the main character, Winston, is described as a smallish, frail figure wearing blue overalls. The building is located in a setting where the electric current is cut off during daylight hours as part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. '"
